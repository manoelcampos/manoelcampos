I'm Manoel Campos, a software engineer for more than 2 decades and a professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Tocantins (Brazil)](http://ifto.edu.br).
Along these years I've worked with lots of technologies and currently I'm a Java expert and learning to love JavaScript and Node.js too (after hating them for so long ‚ò∫Ô∏è).

I love being a teacher and developer. One of my missions is to spread knowledge, good software enginnering practices such as clean code, design patterns, SOLID priciples and more. I pursue to inspire developers to be problem-solvers and to care about the code they write, providing not just code, but value for companies and coworkers.
