### Hi there 👋

<!--
**manoelcampos/manoelcampos** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I'm Manoel Campos, a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D candidate at the [Universidade da Beira Interior](https://www.ubi.pt) (Portugal), working with computer-based simulation and resource optimisation in Cloud Computing environments. I'm a [Cloud Computing Simulation Consultant](#consulting) and the creator of [CloudSim Plus](https://cloudsimplus.org), the state-of-the-art cloud computing simulation framework. 

CloudSim Plus is a fully documented, highly extensible, totally re-engineered and full-featured framework. It's very accurate and has impressive performance improvements, enabling breakthrough cloud computing research. The most recent and important cloud simulation tools rely on it as the underlying platform for building and running simulations.

I have a master degree in Electrical Engineering at the [Universidade de Brasília](https://unb.br) (Brazil) in the area of applications and frameworks for Digital Television (DTV). As a result of my master thesis, I developed open source implementations of [HTTP](https://manoelcampos.com/nclua-http/) and [SOAP](https://manoelcampos.com/nclua-soap/) protocols, an [XML parser](https://manoelcampos.com/xml2lua/) for the Brazilian Digital Television System (ISDB-Tb) and a component library for development of interactive DTV applications.

I have a degree in Data Processing Technology at the [Universidade do Tocantins](https://www.unitins.br) (Brazil) where I worked with development of enterprise information systems. I am a professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Tocantins](http://ifto.edu.br) (Brazil), working on professional, higher education and specialisation courses since 2003. 

I am a software engineering for more than 2 decades, with experience in several programming languages such as C, PHP, Java, NCL, Lua and Shell Script. I work with object oriented analysis, design and programming. I have experience with agile software development using processes such as Test Driven Development (TDD) in order to increase software quality. Along these years I've worked with lots of technologies and currently I'm a Java expert and learning to love JavaScript and Node.js.
